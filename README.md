## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
*  My aim is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning. I need to create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool 
   that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives 
   to use seamlessly.

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING:
* Extracting datas from all the 6 cities excel sheets and convert it into a dataframe in a readable format.
* I removed columns, which had more that 30% null values. I also remove some columns, which are repetitive in the same name with some minor word changes.
* I removed the symbols and commas that present in the numerical columns for model training.
