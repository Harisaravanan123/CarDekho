## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
*  My aim is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning. I need to create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool 
   that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives 
   to use seamlessly.
